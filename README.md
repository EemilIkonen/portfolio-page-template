Here's how you can use this template to showcase your own projects:

In `index.html`:

- Replace the placeholder Font Awesome kit URL in line 14 with your own. More info on kits [here](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/setup/use-kit/).
- Replace the hero quote with your own.
- In the projects section, replace the placeholder content with your own projects. You can add as many project cards as you want by copy & pasting the project card. You can customize the project cards by changing the background image in the style tag and by changing the icons in the icon shelf.
